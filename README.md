# Placement Prediction

This project is student centric and is a practical project that helps student to know their chances of getting placed or not (Low/high). I have used very basic with no tuning of the model and can be used as a foundation for different projects.

## Different Softwares/Libraries used

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python 3.10
- Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Flask, Pickle
- Scikit Learn

## Models used for prediction:

- Logistic Regression

## NOTE
- Remember that model is not very accurate as it has been trained on very small dataset
- can be used as a foundation for different projects/aspects
- Main purpose of the project to show end-to-end project  (it has not been deployed)
